A simple RGB color guessing game. 

You can play it here: https://rayls.io/colorgame/

This project served as a great introduction to DOM manipulation and Javascript. 

This game includes 2 modes, easy and hard, that allow the user to guess what color the RGB code on display is. Easy mode displays 3 colors and hard mode displays 6 colors.

It also includes a counter and displays the average number of guesses the user makes to get the color right.
